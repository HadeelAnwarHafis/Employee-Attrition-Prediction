# Employee Attrition Prediction Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project implements machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition for the **Coding Ninjas 10X AI-ML Program** assignment. The analysis uses a dataset of 9,000 employee records to build predictive models that can help HR departments identify employees at risk of leaving.
